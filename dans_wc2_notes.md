### Items to work on:
- [ ] Remove the `#write` method from `MobRotator` class, simply a wrapper for puts
- [ ] Use email addresses (rather than mobster names) to determine uniqueness
- [ ] Names (MobRotation vs MobRotator) need clarification
- [ ] Random and Help (plus others) are not unit tested
- [ ] Acceptance tests potentially have lots of duplication to be cleaned up
- [ ] Printed documentation does not reflect new `#random` method
- [ ] Refactor tool commands to default to rotate.txt unless flagged otherwise

### Dan's notes for work:
- [ ] Move test helper methods (inside mob_rotation_spec.rb) into spec_helper.rb
- [ ] asdf
